    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tom Yum (ต้มยำ) is a famous, fragrant Thai hot and sour soup known for its
      bold balance of spicy, sour, salty, and sweet flavors, built on a broth
      infused with lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves, often featuring
      shrimp (Tom Yum Goong) but also chicken or fish, available in clear (nam
      sai) or creamy (nam khon) versions, and is a cornerstone of Thai cuisine
      enjoyed with rice as part of a shared meal.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lemongrass: Smashed, cut into pieces to release flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Galangal: Sliced, adds a unique piney aroma (not ginger!).
        </li>
        <li>Makrut Lime Leaves: Torn to release their intense citrusy scent. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare Aromatics & Broth: Bring water or stock to a boil with bruised lemongrass, sliced galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and chilies (fresh or toasted).</li>
        <li>Simmer Protein & Veggies: Add protein (like shrimp, cooked quickly) and mushrooms (oyster or straw) to the broth and simmer briefly until cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes: Stir in tomatoes and cook for a minute or two until they soften slightly.
        </li>
        <li>Season (Off Heat): Turn off the heat and stir in lime juice, fish sauce, sugar (or other sweeteners like tamarind), and optional chili paste (Nam Prik Pao).
        </li>
        <li>Adjust & Finish: Taste and adjust the balance of sour, spicy, and salty flavors. For creamy Tom Yum, stir in evaporated milk or coconut milk at the end.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish & Serve: Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro or green onions, serving hot with rice. 
        </li>
